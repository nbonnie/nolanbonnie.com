              <h3>Prophet Predictive Modeling</h3>
              <h4>Cheif Quantitative Analyst</h4>
              <p class="date">June 2019 - Present</p>
              <p>I am one of three founders of Prophet Predictive Modeling, a financial trading company that implements artificial intelligence to make real time decisions on the US Stock Market. In this company, along with making important administrative decisions, I manage the acquisition and processing of our training data, implement various proven and proprietary quantitative indicators (mutated from our training data), train our model with advanced statistical learning methods, and backtest the model to optimize accuracy and consistency.</p>

              <h3>Sandia National Laboratories</h3>
              <h4>Cybersecurity R&amp;D Intern</h4>
              <p class="date">Summer 2018</p>
              <p>Projects given to the Center of Cyber Defense at Sandia end up being directly implemented into the nationâ€™s cybersecurity efforts. For my first assignment (where most specifics of this project are classified) I was placed as the project manager of a 7 person research team where we created a revolutionary software package designed to be lightweight but effective in protecting government servers. This project was an absolutely crucial proof of concept, where specifically we created a virtualized integrated network monitoring system that is able to mimic a complex integrated network whilst keeping the ability to block cyber attacks from compromising critical infrastructure. The second assignment I joined was managed by cybersecurity expert Vincent Urias, who asked me to join his team after my success on the first project. This project focused on a novel method of preventing cyber attacks using artificial intelligence. Specifically, we were training AI to differentiate between syslogs from normal user activity and intrusive malicious activity. My job on this project was to create all of the testing data for the malicious activity, which included scripting over 200 different cyber attacks to be run remotely on windows operating systems.</p>

              <h3>UC Irvine, Learning and Academic Resource Center</h3>
              <h4>Tutorial Leader</h4>
              <p class="date">Summer 2018 - Present</p>
              <p>I am employed by the UCI department of undergraduate education as a LARC (Learning & Academic Resource Center) tutorial leader. In this position, I lead three supplementary course instruction sessions of classes up to 16 students every quarter. The UCI class I support is a Matlab programming course for engineers (EngrMAE 10). During my LARC sections, I implement proven supplemental instruction methods to help students learn and retain information about Matlab programming.</p>

              <h3>UniFab Industries inc. Intern</h3>
              <p class="date">Summer 2017</p>
              <p>At UniFab I was paired with one of their mechanical engineers working in quality control. As I shadowed him I learned how to do his whole job, and coincidentally he unexpectedly quit halfway through my internship. Without proper time to hire a new candidate, UniFab had me take over all of his responsibilities. For the next 5 weeks I assumed the role of quality control engineer at UniFab, whilst at the same time oversaw a project to re-organize the company's stock room which had over 5000 unique hardware pieces.</p>
