          Hello! My name is Nolan Bonnie, and I received my degree in <span class="green">mathematics</span> from the <span class="blue">University of California, Irvine</span>. My technical skills are primarily centered around statistical learning, data analysis, and AI planning. My end goal is to obtain a <span>Ph.D. in computer science</span>, focusing my research on multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and <span class="orange">group intelligence</span>.

          Welcome to my website! My name is Nolan Bonnie, and I'm a researcher who employs mathematics and <span>statistical learning</span> to model the world around us. I received my bachelor's degree in <span class="blue">mathematics</span> specializing in data science from the University of California, Irvine. I worked hard as an undergraduate student, and you can read about some of my work <a href="html_support/past.html">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          In total, I took 13 courses focused on computer science topics at UC Irvine, helping me develop my technical abilities. I am familiar with over a dozen programming languages, but I have specific expertise in <span class="blue">Python</span>, <span>R</span>, <span class="orange">Spark</span>, and <span class="green">MATLAB</span>. 
          <br><br>
          I have been working at <span class="blue">Sandia National Laboratories</span> for several years. I started as an intern with the Center for Cyber Defenders in 2018, where I joined a group of 16 in Livermore CA. After establishing myself as a hard-working and reliable programmer, I was invited back to Sandia in 2019 and 2020. After my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.sandia.gov/careers/career-possibilities/students-and-postdocs/internships-co-ops/institute-programs/titans-technical-internships-to-advance-national-security/titans-cyber/">virtual internship in 2020</a>, I stayed at Sandia as a virtual year-round intern, working about 20 hours a week until I graduated in <span class="orange">June 2021</span>. After obtaining my bachelor's degree, I was promoted to a full-time <span>member of the technical staff</span> in a cybersecurity research and development team. You can read more about my research at Sandia <a href="html_support/research.html">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          In my spare time, I like to get outside on my <span class="green">mountain bike</span>. I am a certified <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nationalmtb.org/">NICA coach</a>, where I help teach high-school students how to mountain bike safely, effectively, and efficiently. We also teach trail etiquette, wilderness first-aid, and mechanical repairs.
          <br><br>
          Though I am currently a cybersecurity researcher, my technical expertise are concentrated in <span>machine learning</span>, data analysis, and <span class="orange">artificial intelligence</span>. My end goal is to obtain a <span class="blue">Ph.D. in computer science</span>, where I hope to research multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and <span class="green">group intelligence</span>.
