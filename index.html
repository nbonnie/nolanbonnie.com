          Hello! My name is Nolan Bonnie, and I am currently a <span>Computer Science Ph.D. student</span> at the <span class="orange">University of Colorado Boulder</span>, advised by <a href = "https://www.peleglab.com/">Orit Peleg</a>. I received my bachelor's degree in <span class="green">mathematics</span> from the <span class="blue">University of California, Irvine</span>. My technical skills are primarily centered around statistical learning, computer vision, data analysis, software engineering, and AI planning.

          Welcome to my website! My name is Nolan Bonnie, and I'm a <span class="green">Ph.D. student</span> in the computer science department at the <span>University of Colorado Boulder</span>. 
          I'm broadly interested in applying mathematics and computer science to understand the true nature of <span class = "orange">intelligence</span> found in natural systems. 
          I'm currently considering how network structure and information flow work together to contribute towards intelligence in multi-agent systems.
          <br><br>
          I received my bachelor's degree in <span class="blue">mathematics</span> specializing in data science from the <span class="orange">University of California, Irvine</span>. 
          I worked hard as an undergraduate student, and you can read about some of my work <a href="education.html">here</a>. 
          Before I started my Ph.D. program, I was a member of the technical staff at <span class="blue">Sandia National Laboratories</span>. 
          During my time at Sandia, I developed novel AI techniques for cybersecurity applications. 
          You can read more about my research at Sandia <a href="research.html">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          I am also associated with the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/certificate/iqbiology/">Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology</a> Program at CU Boulder. 
          This is a program designed to train interdisciplinary scientists who can operate between traditional research disciplines. 
          <br><br>
          In my spare time, I like to get outside on my <span class="green">mountain bike</span>. 
          I am a certified <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nationalmtb.org/">NICA coach</a>, 
          where I help teach high-school students how to mountain bike safely, effectively, and efficiently. 
          We also teach trail etiquette, wilderness first-aid, and mechanical repairs.
