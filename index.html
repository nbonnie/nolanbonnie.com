          Hello! My name is Nolan Bonnie, and I am currently a <span>Computer Science Ph.D. student</span> at the <span class="orange">University of Colorado Boulder</span>, advised by <a href = "https://www.peleglab.com/">Orit Peleg</a>. I received my bachelor's degree in <span class="green">mathematics</span> from the <span class="blue">University of California, Irvine</span>. My research spans complex systems, excitable networks, computer vision, and the <span class="green">physics of living systems</span>, with a focus on emergent patterns and information flow in <span class="orange">swarm intelligence</span>. My technical expertise includes statistical learning, AI planning, <span class="blue">computer vision</span>, spatiotemporal reconstruction, and network analysis.

          Welcome to my website! My name is Nolan Bonnie, and I'm a <span class="green">Ph.D. student</span> in the computer science department at the <span>University of Colorado Boulder</span>. I am fascinated by the application of <span class="blue">complex systems</span> theory and computational modeling to explore the emergent nature of <span class="orange">intelligence</span> in biological and artificial systems. My current work centers on how <span class="green">network structures</span> and <span class="orange">information flow</span> mechanisms combine to produce intelligent behavior in <span class="blue">multi-agent systems</span>.
          <br><br>
          I received my bachelor's degree in <span class="blue">mathematics</span> with a specialization in data science from the <span class="orange">University of California, Irvine</span>, where I first developed a passion for data-driven research. As an undergraduate, I had the opportunity to contribute to several research projects, which you can read about <a href="education.html">here</a>. Before starting my Ph.D., I was a member of the technical staff at <span class="blue">Sandia National Laboratories</span>, where I developed novel <span class="green">AI planning</span> and <span class="orange">cybersecurity</span> techniques for national security applications. You can read more about my work at Sandia <a href="research.html">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          I am also associated with the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/certificate/iqbiology/">Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology</a> Program at CU Boulder, a unique program designed to train scientists to bridge traditional research disciplines and work effectively in interdisciplinary teams.
          <br><br>
          In my spare time, you can find me outside <span class="orange">running</span>, <span class="blue">climbing</span>, or capturing moments through <a href="https://nolanbonnie.com/portfolio/portfolio.html">photography</a>. I especially love getting out on my <span class="green">mountain bike</span>. I am a certified <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.nationalmtb.org/">NICA coach</a>, helping high-school students develop skills for safe and efficient mountain biking. I also enjoy teaching them about trail etiquette, <span class="orange">wilderness first-aid</span>, and <span class="blue">mechanical repairs</span>.
